# Unitary_LT_Preserves_Inner_Products
Proof that a unitary linear transformation preserves the inner product between two arbitrary vectors.

A brief confirmation of Merminâ€™s (2007) (uncontentious) claim a unitary linear transformation preserves the
inner product between any two arbitrary vectors, beginning with a relatively concrete representation of
a unitary linear transformation with a 2 x 2 unitary matrix U, then:
(1) a demonstration that U is indeed unitary;
(2) a demonstration that U preserves the magnitude of a specific unit vector;
(3) a demonstration that U preserves the magnitude of an arbitrary vector (with complex coordinate coefficients);
(4) a demonstration that U preserves the inner product of two aribitrary vectors in a 2D complex vector space;
and (5) a proof that any N x N complex unitary matrix preserves the inner product of two arbitrary vectors in an N-dimensional complex vector space (making using of laws of transpose and associativity of matrix multiplication).
