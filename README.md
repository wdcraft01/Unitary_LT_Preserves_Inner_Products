# Unitary_LT_Preserves_Inner_Products
Proof that a unitary linear transformation preserves the inner product between two arbitrary vectors.

A brief confirmation of Merminâ€™s (2007) (uncontentious) claim a unitary linear transformation preserves the
inner product between any two arbitrary vectors, beginning with a relatively concrete representation of
a unitary linear transformation with a 2 x 2 unitary matrix.
